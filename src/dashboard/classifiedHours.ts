// ============================================================
// Entry-level hours classifier — the SINGLE filtration shared by the monthly
// dashboard model and the on-tempo weekly goals sheets, so both report the same
// utilization numerator (billable ÷ 1880/12) and reconcile at month close.
//
// TWO BASES, computed in one pass (see `cls` vs `clsRaw` below):
//
// RAW basis (`clsRaw`) — Clio's native entry-level `non_billable` flag, and
// nothing else. This is the figure 26 Compare carried from #186 until the
// internal-time adjustment below, and it is what `billable_actual_raw` reports:
//   nonbillable — non_billable === true. Price is irrelevant: internal work
//                 booked at a dollar rate (e.g. a $525/hr RomSum admin entry)
//                 but flagged non-billable in Clio is nonbillable.
//   excluded    — one of Rachel's synthetic 1-hour fee-placeholder entries
//                 (off-standard-rate 1.0h BILLABLE-flagged entry on a fee-based
//                 matter, per the two-step rule in excludedHours.ts). Not real
//                 worked time: dropped from BOTH billable and nonbillable.
//   billable    — everything else (non_billable === false).
//
// ADJUSTED basis (`cls`) — the raw basis PLUS the firm-internal reclassification,
// active whenever `excludeInternal` is true (the DEFAULT). Rate and the matter's
// client ARE consulted here: a billable-flagged entry is moved to NONBILLABLE
// when either
//   (a) the matter's client is the firm itself (FIRM_SELF_CLIENT_ID) — the
//       structural signal. Catches 02888-Admin, 00050-Potential Clients, and any
//       future internal matter automatically, with no name/number list to
//       maintain; or
//   (b) the entry is billable-flagged but carries NO money — rate 0 AND amount 0
//       — the rate-based safety net for internal time booked under some other
//       client.
// Reclassified hours MOVE to nonbillable: they are still tracked time, so
// total (billable + nonbillable) is unchanged on both bases and the dashboard's
// "Untracked" column can't drift. The size of the move is reported separately
// (see `internalHours`) so the two bases always reconcile explicitly.
//
// WHY: #186 (2026-07-15) made the split flag-only, dropping BOTH guards that had
// been keeping $0 firm-internal time out of billable — the pre-2026-07-09
// `price > 0` heuristic and the 2026-07-09 admin-matter-prefix rule. That fixed
// the mirror-image leak (rated RomSum time flagged non-billable was landing in
// billable) but opened this one: 184.0 hrs of $0 "billable" time on 02888-Admin
// and 00050-Potential Clients inflated one timekeeper's YTD over/under from
// ~+345 to +529. Rule (a) restores the structural guard without reintroducing a
// matter-name heuristic.
//
// CAVEAT on rule (b): a genuinely $0-priced entry on a CLIENT matter — real
// worked time on a contingency or flat-fee matter that was never given a rate —
// also has rate 0 / amount 0, so rule (b) will move it to nonbillable too. This
// is the same under-count the pre-2026-07-09 `price > 0` heuristic had and that
// e163235 called out.
//
// CAVEAT on rule (a): client 866197764 is NOT exclusively internal. As of
// 2026-08-24 it owns 25 matters, and while that set is a superset of the four
// old admin prefixes (00706/00316, 00050, 00707, 02888) plus the #186
// RomSum-Marketing/Finance matters, it ALSO carries matters holding real rated
// client work — notably 02671-Anike Fort Bend Property Ownership (16.2 hrs /
// $6,077 of title, contract and eminent-domain work in 2026 at $195–$525) and
// 01537-Mediation Services (0.6 hrs at $450/$125). Rule (a) moves those to
// nonbillable too, which UNDER-counts billable. That is the specified behavior —
// rule (a) is deliberately client-based, not rate-based, so it still catches
// internal work booked at a rate — but the exposure is measured rather than
// hidden: `firmSelfClientRatedHours` counts the firm-self-client hours that
// carried money, which is exactly the suspicious population. If that number is
// material, the fix is a matter-level exception list for the handful of
// client-work matters filed under the firm, not loosening rule (a).
//
// All three counters (firmSelfClientHours, firmSelfClientRatedHours,
// zeroValueHours) are reported so both exposures stay visible.
