// ============================================================
// Worked-hours builder for 26 Compare "Billable Hours" (col I) / "TNB" (col H).
//
// Col I = ALL billable hours WORKED in the month, by activity/work date, billed or
// not — a TIME-ENTRY query (the firm's definition), NOT the Revenue Report's
// "Billed Hours + Unbilled Hours". The Revenue Report's Billed Hours is invoice/
// issue-date based, so it counts prior-month work billed this month and, added to
// current WIP, OVERCOUNTS hours actually worked in the month. Verified against the
// firm's reference dashboard for March 2026:
//   NRN: time-entry worked 210.6 ≈ reference 212.0   (Revenue Report said 262.6)
//   PAR: time-entry worked 250.4 ≈ reference 250.0   (Revenue Report said 291.2)
//
// Billable vs nonbillable uses the SAME two-basis decision as the weekly goal
// sheets (classifiedHours.ts): Clio's entry-level non_billable flag, PLUS the
// firm-internal reclassification when `excludeInternal` is set (the default) —
// a billable-flagged entry whose matter's client is the firm itself, or which
// carries rate 0 AND amount 0, moves to nonbillable. Matter names, numbers,
// types and practice areas are still never consulted.
//
// Both bases come back from one pull: `billable`/`nonbillable` are the ADJUSTED
// figures col I and col H are written from, and `billableRaw`/`nonbillableRaw`
// are the flag-only figures, kept so a run can log exactly how much the
// adjustment moved. Real worked time on contingency/flat-fee matters that
// carries a rate IS still billable (the reference includes it — e.g. PAR's 48.4h
// on the Teachworth contingency matter are in his 250.0). Only Rachel's
// synthetic 1-hour fee-placeholder entries are backed out, and that happens
// separately via buildExcludedHoursByMonth (see excludedHours.ts).

//   nonbillableRaw = flag-only nonbillable (non_billable === true).
//   internal       = hours the adjustment moved: billableRaw − billable.
